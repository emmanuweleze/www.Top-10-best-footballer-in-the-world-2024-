         <h2>TOP.2 LIONEL MESSI: This is the 2nd bestplayerLionel Messi (born June 24, 1987, Rosario, Argentina) is an Argentine-born football (soccer) player who received a record-setting eight Ballon d’Or awards as the world’s top male player (2009–12, 2015, 2019, 2021, and 2023). In 2022 he helped Argentina win the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)’s World Cup.Messi started playing football as a boy and in 1995 joined the youth team of Newell’s Old Boys (a Rosario-based top-division football club). Messi’s phenomenal skills garnered the attention of prestigious clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. At age 13 Messi and his family relocated to Barcelona, and he began playing for FC Barcelona’s under-14 team. He scored 21 goals in 14 games for the junior team, and he quickly graduated through the higher-level teams until at age 16 he was given his informal debut with FC Barcelona in a friendly match.Messi’s play continued to rapidly improve over the years, and by 2008 he was one of the most dominant players in the world, finishing second to Manchester United’s Cristiano Ronaldo in the voting for the 2008 Ballon d’Or. In early 2009 Messi capped off a spectacular 2008–09 season by helping FC Barcelona capture the club’s first “treble” (winning three major European club titles in one season): the team won the La Liga championship, the Copa del Rey (Spain’s major domestic cup), and the Champions League title. He scored 38 goals in 51 matches during that season, and he bested Ronaldo in the balloting for both the Ballon d’Or and FIFA’s world player of the year by a record margin. During the 2009–10 season Messi scored 34 goals in domestic games as Barcelona repeated as La Liga champions. He earned the Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, and he received another Ballon d’Or (the award was known as the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010–15).</h2>

        <h2>TOP3:KYLIAN MBAPPE Mbappé (born December 20, 1998, Paris, France) is a French football (soccer) player whose speed and goal scoring as an attacker have made him a dominant force in European club competition. In 2022 he became the first player in football history to have scored four career goals in World Cup finals.Kylian Mbappé was born in Paris and grew up in Bondy, one of the Parisian suburbs (banlieues) with working-class, mostly immigrant residents. His mother, Fayza Lamari, is of Algerian descent, and his father, Wilfried Mbappé, had immigrated from Cameroon. Wilfried Mbappé was a coach and director for the local club AS Bondy, and his son joined the club’s youth teams at age six.Kylian Mbappé quickly became known for his exceptional speed and ball handling, and, several years later, he was selected to train at Clairefontaine, France’s national academy for elite football players. He spent two years there, and a number of notable European clubs—among them Real Madrid, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)—expressed an interest in signing him.In 2013, at age 14, he signed with AS Monaco, which competes in Ligue 1 (France’s top-division league), and he played on the club’s youth and under-19 When Mbappé made his debut with AS Monaco’s first team—on December 2, 2015—he was just a few weeks shy of his 17th birthday.

        <h2>TOP 4:NEYMAR:Neymar (born February 5, 1992, Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil) is a Brazilian football (soccer) player who is one of the most prolific scorers in his country’s storied football history.Neymar began playing football as a boy in São Vicente, under the guidance of his father, a former professional footballer who remained a close adviser and mentor throughout his son’s career. Having played street and indoor five-a-side football, Neymar joined Portuguesa Santista’s youth team in São Vicente, and in 2003 he and his family moved to Santos. There Neymar, who was already an impressive player, joined the youth academy of Santos FC (the same club for which Brazilian football legend Pelé starred over the majority of his domestic career). At age 14 he had a successful trial with Spain’s Real Madrid, and Santos had to increase its spending to retain him.Neymar—a slender-framed 5-foot 9-inch (1.75-metre) forward—was supremely confident on the field, with excellent body control, quick reflexes, and explosive speed. He made his first team debut with Santos in 2009. While playing with Santos, he averaged a goal every other match and helped the team win the Libertadores Cup (the most prestigious South American club competition) in 2011. Neymar’s many individual honours with Santos included the South American Footballer of the Year title in 2011 and 2012.In June 2013 Neymar signed a five-year contract with FC Barcelona after a trade with Santos in exchange for €57 million (about $76 million), one of the most expensive soccer transfers in history. Two years later he helped Barcelona capture the “treble” of a La Liga championship, a Copa del Rey title, and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions League title. While Neymar was instrumental in Barcelona’s success from 2013 to 2017, totaling 105 goals in 186 games with the club across all competitions, he longed to get out of the shadow of teammate Lionel Messi, one of the greatest players in football history. As a result, in August 2017 he engineered a departure to the French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) for a then record €222 million ($263 million) transfer fee. The move also made Neymar the highest-paid player in the world at the time, with a €45 million ($53 million) annual salary. PSG also signed Kylian Mbappé in August 2017. Neymar appeared in just 30 matches during his first season with PSG, scoring 28 goals for the club before breaking a bone in his right foot, though PSG powered to the Ligue 1 title in the 2017–18 season as well as in 2018–19 and 2019–20. In 2021—the same year that Messi signed with PSG—Neymar agreed to a contract extension that committed him to PSG until 2025. Neymar, Mbappé, and Messi became one of the most formidable front lines in all of football.Internationally, Neymar was considered for the Brazilian side that participated in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, but he was ultimately not included on the squad. Instead, he made his debut for the national team in August 2010, in a friendly match against the U.S., where he scored his first international goal in Brazil’s 2–0 win. He scored four goals for Brazil at the 2013 Confederations Cup, including one in the team’s 3–0 victory over Spain in the final, and won the Golden Ball as the tournament’s most valuable player as well as the Bronze Boot as its third highest scorer. Neymar starred for Brazil when his home country hosted the 2014 World Cup, scoring four goals in five games before he was knocked out of the competition with a fractured vertebra in the quarterfinals. Without the team’s most important player, Brazil lost by a shocking 7–1 margin to eventual-champion Germany in the semifinals. Despite his early exit from the tournament, Neymar won the Bronze Boot. At the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, he led the Brazilian men’s side to its first Olympic gold medal, scoring the winning penalty in extra time of the final match against GermanyNeymar scored two goals at the 2018 World Cup but was as well-known for his many theatrical embellishments of fouls during that tournament (Neymar was the most-fouled player in the event) as for his on-field play. Brazil’s World Cup appearance ended with a quarterfinal loss to Belgium. During the 2022 World Cup, Neymar suffered an ankle injury and was forced to miss several games. In the quarterfinal match against Croatia, he scored his 77th international goal. However, Brazil lost in a penalty shootout.Off field, Neymar experienced legal troubles. In 2012 a Brazilian court ordered him and his father to pay substantial back taxes from 2007 to 2008. An appeal was denied in 2016, and that year a Brazilian court additionally found Neymar guilty of having falsified documents in order to avoid paying taxes on income received in 2011–13. The player and his father were also called into Spanish court after an investment fund that had sponsored him alleged that it had been defrauded during his 2013 transfer to Barcelona.
